This project was completed in the second year of University. I was part of a 7
person team that made a data visualisation program that takes in a CSV file,
and creates a graph relating to that data. Once we had completed the project,
we had to swap with another team, and modify their program to make it better. 

My initial tasks were:
 - Create a Pie Chart from the CSV file
 - Create an Area Chart from the csv file

Both of these were passed onto another team.
 
We all helped each other out with certain tasks, and then modified another groups
program.
